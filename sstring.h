 * \brief This module provides a « safer » string.
 * 
 * These are not C-string but a \c struct that holds the length of the string and a pointer to the actual char sequence.
 * Please note that there is no \c '\0' to mark the end of the \c sstring.
 *
 * Empty string is encoded by 0 \c length and \c NULL \c pointer.
 *
 * assert is enforced.
 *
 * \note Cela ressemble au TDM 1, même s'il y a des différences.
